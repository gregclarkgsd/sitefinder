# GSD SiteFinder

Private construction-lead identification tool for GSD Decorating. It reads the public Considerate Constructors Scheme marker feed and retrieves an individual public CCS record when a user opens a project.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`; the local API runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

Without Supabase environment variables the application operates in local-preview mode. For the hosted team workspace, configure:

```text
VITE_SUPABASE_URL
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

Never expose a Supabase secret/service-role key to the frontend.

## Production

The included `render.yaml` builds and serves the React application and Express API as one Render web service. Apply the SQL migration in `supabase/migrations` to a dedicated Supabase project before deploying.

## Data source

- Marker feed: `https://ccsfilestore.blob.core.windows.net/constructionmap/live/json/sitemarkers.json`
- Detail record: `https://portal.ccscheme.org.uk/api/searchwebapi/getsiteposterdetails/{SITE_ID}/null`

Use is intended for authorised GSD Decorating employees and remains subject to CCS terms and applicable data-protection requirements.
